# PHASE 1 — RESEARCH

## 1.0 — Peers

`ListAgents` at session start: *"No reachable agents — no other Claude session is running on this machine
right now."* This session is `framefocus-21`. **No peer, so no stop.**

## 1.1 — The ground (ref: `origin/main` after `git fetch --prune`, 2026-10-03)

- `origin/main` = **`fc220fd0`** *"docs: S127 prompt and open-work bundle [skip ci]"*. The prompt expected
  `71a039d5`; `fc220fd0` is its direct child and adds only the prompt and the bundle. The checkout was on `main`
  at session start; no edits were made there.
- `docs/specs/OPEN-WORK-BUNDLE.md` is on `main` (841 lines), read in full.
- The claimed SHAs, checked with `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/main`:

| part | SHA | on `main`? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S124 Part 0 (email pacing) | `5a78a648` | ✅ yes |
| S124 Part 2 (the switch) | `81fe1efc` | ✅ yes |
| S124 Parts 1 + 3 | `9e08c3dc` (`feature/s124-p1-push` head, confirmed) | ✅ **NOT** on main, as claimed |
| S125 audit report | `71a039d5` | ✅ yes |

## 1.2 — S124's report rescued

`git log --all --pretty=format: --name-only -- '*S124*report*' | sort -u` → exactly one path,
`docs/sessions/S124-report.md`, present only on `feature/s124-qb-timesheets` (`d49ed832`). Brought onto `main`
with its prompt and spec as **`c92900e2`** (docs only, `[skip ci]`, a fast-forward of `fc220fd0`). Read back:
`git ls-tree origin/main docs/sessions/` lists `S124-report.md` once. One report file, not two.
(`feature/s124-qb-timesheets` also carries `test/qb-sandbox-gate.ts` and its live test. Those belong to Part 1,
which is DO NOT TOUCH, and they also exist on `feature/s124-p1-push`. Not brought over.)

## 1.3 — Does `main` require a passing status check? **NO.**

- `gh api repos/IronFrame414/FrameFocus/branches/main` → `"protected": false`,
  `required_status_checks.enforcement_level: "off"`, `checks: []`, `contexts: []`.
- `gh api repos/IronFrame414/FrameFocus/rulesets` → `[]` (no rulesets).
- `…/branches/main/protection` → HTTP 403 *"Resource not accessible by integration"*. That is the token's scope, not
  an answer, so it is not counted.
- Corroboration by effect: `fc220fd0` and `c92900e2` were pushed straight to `main` with `[skip ci]` and accepted.

⇒ **§ 8 rule 1 applies:** a merge may carry `[skip ci]` when tree identity is proven and printed. No proof, no skip.
